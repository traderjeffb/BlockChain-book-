# Ethereum

#### **Ethereum**

Ethereum is both an open-source blockchain and an operating system featuring smart contracts. Let’s get started exploring Ethereum. First, let’s download MetaMask.

#### **MetaMask**

Metamask is a Google plugin that allows us to view decentralized apps right on our Chrome browser without having to run the full Ethereum node. Basically, it's an Ethereum browser. Additionally, it provides a wallet to hold your cryptocurrency. If you don’t already have Google’s Chrome browser download it here:

Now that we’ve got Chrome installed. Let’s get the MetaMask Extension. go to the link below to download MetaMask.

Once MetaMask is installed you should have this icon in the corner of your Chrome browser

Now click that MetaMask Icon to open it. First you will see the privacy notice. Click the “Accept” button.

Next you will see the “Terms of Use”. You must scroll to the bottom of this page before the “Accept” button will become active. After scrolling to the bottom, click “Accept”.

The legal stuff is complete.

Now you will be prompted to set up an account. Enter a password to create your new account.

Now your wallet \(vault\) has been created. MetaMask gives you 12 “seed words” that are the only way to restore your MetaMask account. Make certain you save them in a file. You may want to save a second copy someplace other than your computer in case your computer is stolen or severely malfunctions. Copy the words to a file, name the file something you will remember and save it. Once that’s complete click the “I’ve copied it somewhere safe” button.

This is your new MetaMask Wallet. Currently it is empty.

Let’s explore MetaMask. If you click on the Account icon you’ll see this drop-down menu.

It's quite common among cryptocurrency traders to have multiple wallets. Some create multiple wallets to split their cryptocurrency holdings into smaller amounts as another layer of protection. Others create multiple wallets for organization of many different cryptocurrencies. Click "Account 1" on the menu to close this drop down. Hover your mouse above the word "Account One" on the main page. The word "edit" will appear.

Let's change the name of our account. I'll call mine "My Account" but feel free to name your account anything you wish. Once you have renamed your account. Click "Save".

Now click on the words "Main Network". Here you will see a list of the possible Networks that we can connect our MetaMask wallet to. In this course we will be connecting to one of the test networks in order to practice with Ethereum for no cost. If we were on the Main Ethereum Network each and every transaction would have a fee associated with it.

Now click on the 3 dots. \(See below\) The first choice is to "View account on Etherscan" we'll come back to that choice later. the Second is to "Show QR Code" clicking this will give you a QR code that is your public key. You can use this QR code to receive payments. "Copy address to clipboard" is the choice you will use most often. This choice copies your wallet's public key that you can then paste and share however you wish in order to receive Ether. You cannot lose any Ether by sharing your public key. The last choice is "Export Private Key" If you click this MetaMask will give you a warning; "Export Private Key at your own Risk". We'll revisit the MetaMask wallet later in our class.
