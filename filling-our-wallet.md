# What is Ether?

Unlike mining a Bitcoin, which is called a Bitcoin, Ethereum calls the results of mining a coin an Ether. 

Confused? Just wait... it gets even better.

 Ethereum is a network. Ether is the cryptocurrency used to power the Ethereum network. Ether can be traded, it can appreciate & depreciate, it can be used to pay for things \(provided the seller accepts Ether\) and it can be turned into US dollars. Ethereum can be used for smart contracts, banking and many other things. It's a platform. 

# What is Wei?

Wei is one of several names give to the different denominations of Ether. This might help. Pretend you have a $1,000 bill. Now there are several ways you could split it up. You could use $100's, $50's, $20's, $10's, $5s, 1's, Sacagawea coins, 50cent pieces, quarters, dimes, nickles, pennies and probably even others that aren't listed here. All of those are just names of fractions of your $1,000 bill.  As you can see below Wei is a denomination of Ether.

# What is Gas?

Whenever you use the Ethereum blockchain network there's a  transaction cost involved. That transaction cost is represented in "gas".  When you pay for the "gas" you use Ether or more commonly the denomination of Ether called Wei. Remember this-when you pay for the gas you are paying for the cost of computing the transaction on the Ethereum network regardless if it fails or succeeds. 

# How are Transaction Fees Priced?

Transaction fees also called "TX fees" are priced in gas. Why? Because all possible transaction that the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EMV\) can do are already hard coded into the programs that run the nodes. By having the gas prices for each transaction, there will never be a need to reprogram in order to change the fees. If the fees were priced in Ether there would need to be changes made constantly to the program.
