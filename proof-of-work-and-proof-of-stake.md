# Proof of Work

Proof of Work is the concept that deters "denial of service" or spam attacks from occurring on a blockchain. The protocol is simply the concept that the cost of doing the work will deter bad actors from attempting a denial of service attack due to the cost of CPUs and the vast number of CPUs it would require to create an attack. 

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum use a proof of work protocol  however, Ethereum has announced it will change to Proof of Stake but has given no date as to when this will happen. 



# Proof of Stake

The proof of stake concept is that those who hold a cryptocurrency are the only ones who can mine that currency's proof of work blocks. The benefits are 2 fold. For example, if you owned 2% of Ethereum you would then be allowed to mine 2% of the proof of work blocks. The benefits are 2 fold. First it would lower the probability of an denial of service attack due to the sheer cost of owning enough of any given cryptocurrency to create an effective attack. Secondly, the person creating the attack is harmed in the process because of their ownership.



# What is a denial of service attack?

A malicious attack via overwhelming a server with requests therefore making it impossible for legitimate users gain access.





\*The arguments as to why Proof of Stake will or will not work for cryptocurrency is beyond this course of study. There are plenty of places to read the debates online
