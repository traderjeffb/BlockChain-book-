Remix is a web browser based IDE used to write, test. debug and deploy smart contracts and Dapps. It allows a lot of trial and error inspection while programming a smart contract or Dapp. Interacting with our smart contract is very easy with Remix. The Remix GUI is separated into 4 panels. Remix provides you with sample code the first time you access it. It is easier if we remove this code and start fresh by building smart contracts from scratch and building your knowledge step by step. We will delete this sample code below. \(but not yet, first let's look around\)

In the center on the top panel we have the Solidity Editor:

\(this is where you will spend most of your time writing smart contracts and Dapps\)

Below the Editor is the Terminal:![](/assets/Remix terminal.jpg)And to the far right side we have the Tabs Panel:

On the left side of the Remix you will see the file explorer with a little triangle to the left of the word "browser"

You will see the file named "ballot.sol" right click on this file and you will see:

Click "Delete":

Remix will ask you "Do you want to delete this file?" Click "OK".

Now let's get started writing smart contracts!
