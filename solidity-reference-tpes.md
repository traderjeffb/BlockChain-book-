# Complex Reference types

Because copying a larger amount of data can be expensive if we were to store it in Storage, we have to determine how we want a complex types to be stored. Solidity provides additional annotation for Arrays and Structs in order to determine where it is stored. The key words that annotate where an Array or Struct will be stored are storage and memory.
