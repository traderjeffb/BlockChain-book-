# Public and Private Keys

Each wallet contains public and private. A key is a sting of bits \(1's and -0's\) that is used by a cryptographic algorithm to transform text into illegible hash. The 2 keys are "mathematically related" to each other. The public key can be shared with anyone and can be posted publicly. The private key should never be given to anyone. Anyone who has the private key has access to anything in the account. The public key is used to receive data and that data can only be deciphered with the private key.

# How are these keys used?

Let's say Trevor wants to send Katie some private information.  Katie can send Trevor her public key and Trevor can use this to send her the data. Only Katie will be able to decipher the information because only Katie will have access to her private key. It is this security feature of smart contracts that make them the wave of the future.
